"],["how-i-created-this-bookdown.html", "1.1 How I created this bookdown?", " 1.1 How I created this bookdown? I first started from following a Youtube tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdSmYvbQkhs&amp;t=192s A creation of bookdown is done by bookdown package (Xie 2021). So I started to read a tutorial of bookdown package (Xie 2016) for the detailed explanation : https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/ 1.1.1 Gitbook template The easiest way to get started writing a new gitbook is to use the RStudio Project Wizard (File &gt; New Project &gt; New Directory &gt; Book project using bookdown) and select gitbook from the dropdown menu. https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/html.html#fig:new-bs4-book This will create several files such as .Rmd, .yml, .bib to build a template bookdown. 1.1.2 Initialize git We initialize this bookdown with git, so that we can take advantage of version control and upload in Github. git init git add --all git commit -m &quot;Initial bookdown template&quot; 1.1.3 Change .yml files In output.yml file, there are three sections as below. We would only like to keep bookdown::gitbook: command but want to comment out bookdown::pdf_book: and bookdown::epub_book: default. This is how my output.yml will look like after commenting out unnecessary lines. This is because, to render this example to PDF as a bookdown::pdf_book, youll need to install XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.org/tinytex/. bookdown::gitbook: css: style.css config: toc: before: | &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;./&quot;&gt;A Minimal Book Example&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; after: | &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;Published with bookdown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; edit: https://github.com/jennyjyounglee/Analysis_Bookdown/edit/BRANCH/%s download: [&quot;pdf&quot;, &quot;epub&quot;] # bookdown::pdf_book: # includes: # in_header: preamble.tex # latex_engine: xelatex # citation_package: natbib # keep_tex: yes # bookdown::epub_book: default In _bookdown.yml file, we need to add two of the followings: book_filename: \"Analysis_Bookdown\" output_dir: \"docs\" This is how my _bookdown.yml will look like after adding the above two lines. book_filename: &quot;Analysis_Bookdown&quot; delete_merged_file: true output_dir: &quot;docs&quot; language: ui: chapter_name: &quot;Chapter &quot; We again commit the changes we made on _output.yml and _bookdown.yml files. git status git add _bookdown.yml git add _output.yml git commit -m &quot;Change bookdown output defaults&quot; 1.1.4 Render a book You can render the HTML version of this example book without changing anything: In Rstudio &gt; Build &gt; Build Book. i.e.Â Find the Build pane in the RStudio IDE, and click on Build Book, then select your output format, or select All formats if youd like to use multiple formats from the same book source files. Or build the book from the R console: bookdown::render_book() This will create two folders /docs and _bookdown_files. - /docs contains .html file created from .Rmd files - bookdown_files contains complied images, which we dont need to commit image files. So we add a line bookdown_files in .gitignore. This is how my .gitignore file looks like. .Rproj.user .Rhistory .RData .Ruserdata _bookdown_files We again commit the changes we made on .gitignore and docs/ files. git add .gitignore git add docs/ git commit -m &quot;Ignore bookdown files created on build&quot; 1.1.5 Push to Github First, we need to create a repo in Github Create a repo name Analysis_Bookdown in Github: https://github.com/jennyjyounglee/Analysis_Bookdown Then, run the below code to push local repo to Github. git remote add origin https://github.com/jennyjyounglee/Analysis_Bookdown.git git branch -M main git push -u origin main 1.1.6 Publish the website! In Github &gt; Analysis_Bookdown repo &gt; Settings &gt; Pages &gt; Source/Master/Docs/ Then your website should be available through https://jennyjyounglee.github.io/Analysis_Bookdown References "],["usage.html", "1.2 Usage", " 1.2 Usage Each bookdown chapter is an .Rmd file, and each .Rmd file can contain one (and only one) chapter. A chapter must start with a first-level heading: # A good chapter, and can contain one (and only one) first-level heading. Use second-level and higher headings within chapters like: ## A short section or ### An even shorter section. The index.Rmd file is required, and is also your first book chapter. It will be the homepage when you render the book. "],["preview-book.html", "1.3 Preview book", " 1.3 Preview book As you work, you may start a local server to live preview this HTML book. This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files.

A BibTeX database is a plain-text file (with the conventional filename extension .bib) that consists of bibliography entries like this: @Manual{R-base, title = {R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing}, author = {{R Core Team}}, organization = {R Foundation for Statistical Computing}, address = {Vienna, Austria}, year = {2016}, url = {https://www.R-project.org/}, } There is a helper function write_bib() in knitr to generate BibTeX entries automatically for R packages. For example, I created this citation (Xie 2021) by typing [@R-bookdown]. I copy and pasted the output rendered from the below code in .bib file https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/citations.html. # the second argument can be a .bib file knitr::write_bib(c(&#39;bookdown&#39;), &#39;&#39;, width = 60) References "],["output-formats.html", "1.5 Output Formats", " 1.5 Output Formats The split_by argument specifies how you want to split the HTML output into multiple pages, and its possible values are: rmd: use the base filenames of the input Rmd files to create the HTML filenames, e.g., generate chapter3.html for chapter3.Rmd. none: do not split the HTML file (the book will be a single HTML file). chapter: split the file by the a first-level (#) headers. section: split the file by the a second-level (##) headers. chapter+number and section+number: similar to chapter and section, but the files will be numbered.
